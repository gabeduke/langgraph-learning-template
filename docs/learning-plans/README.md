# LangGraph Learning Plans

This directory contains comprehensive learning plans for mastering LangGraph and building production-ready agent systems.

## 🎯 Learning Path Overview

The learning plans are designed to take you from basic understanding to advanced production patterns:

1. **[Understand Current Code](01-understand-current-code.md)** - Master the existing implementation
2. **[Interfaces and Extensibility](02-interfaces-and-extensibility.md)** - Deep dive into LangGraph interfaces
3. **[State Stores and Persistence](03-state-stores-and-persistence.md)** - Master state management patterns
4. **[Production Patterns](04-production-patterns.md)** - Learn production-ready patterns
5. **[MuleSoft Integration](05-mulesoft-integration.md)** - Integrate with MuleSoft ecosystems

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for advanced exercises)
- MuleSoft environment (for integration exercises)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Set up the learning environment
make setup
make setup-env

# Start with Learning Plan 1
cd docs/learning-plans
python test_learning_01.py
```

## 📚 Learning Plan Structure

Each learning plan includes:

- **Objective**: Clear learning goals
- **What You'll Learn**: Detailed learning outcomes
- **Learning Exercises**: Hands-on exercises with expected outputs
- **Test File**: Comprehensive test suite for validation
- **Success Criteria**: Clear completion requirements
- **Next Steps**: Path to continue learning
- **Additional Resources**: Links to relevant documentation

## 🧪 Testing Your Progress

Each learning plan includes a comprehensive test file that validates your understanding:

```bash
# Run tests for a specific learning plan
python test_learning_01.py
python test_learning_02.py
# ... etc

# Run all learning plan tests
pytest docs/learning-plans/test_learning_*.py -v
```
