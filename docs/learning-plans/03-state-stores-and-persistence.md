## üîç State Storage Backends

### 1. **Memory Storage**
- `MemorySaver` for development and testing
- In-memory state management
- Session isolation patterns
- Performance characteristics

### 2. **Redis Storage**
- `RedisSaver` for production use
- Distributed state management
- TTL and expiration policies
- Clustering and high availability

### 3. **PostgreSQL Storage**
- `PostgresSaver` for enterprise use
- ACID compliance and transactions
- Complex queries and analytics
- Backup and recovery strategies

### 4. **Custom Storage**
- Building custom checkpointers
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and recovery

## üß™ Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Memory Storage Deep Dive
**Goal**: Understand memory storage patterns and limitations

**Tasks**:
1. Implement custom memory storage with LRU eviction
2. Add memory usage monitoring and alerts
3. Create memory compression for large states
4. Build memory-based session analytics

**Expected Output**: Advanced memory storage system

### Exercise 2: Redis Integration
**Goal**: Master Redis-based state persistence

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Redis cluster for high availability
2. Implement custom serialization for complex states
3. Add Redis-based session management
4. Build Redis monitoring and health checks

**Expected Output**: Production-ready Redis integration

### Exercise 3: PostgreSQL Persistence
**Goal**: Build enterprise-grade state persistence

**Tasks**:
1. Design PostgreSQL schema for state storage
2. Implement state versioning and migration
3. Add state analytics and reporting
4. Build backup and recovery procedures

**Expected Output**: Enterprise state management system

### Exercise 4: Custom Storage Backend
**Goal**: Create custom storage for specific requirements

**Tasks**:
1. Build a file-based storage system
2. Implement S3-based state storage
3. Create a hybrid storage system
4. Add custom storage monitoring

**Expected Output**: Custom storage solutions

### Exercise 5: State Migration and Versioning
**Goal**: Handle state schema changes and migrations

**Tasks**:
1. Implement state versioning system
2. Build migration tools for schema changes
3. Add backward compatibility support
4. Create state validation and repair tools

**Expected Output**: Robust state migration system
