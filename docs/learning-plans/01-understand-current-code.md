# Learning Plan 1: Understand Current LangGraph Implementation

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Test-Driven Understanding Approach

**This learning plan uses FAILING TESTS to guide your understanding!**

- 🟢 **Some tests pass** - existing functionality works correctly
- 🔴 **Some tests fail** - you need to implement basic extensions  
- 📖 **Read failing tests** to understand what to implement
- 🔧 **Implement solutions** to prove your understanding
- ✅ **Tests passing** means you've demonstrated mastery

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the tests - some will fail (this is expected!)
make test-learning PLAN=01

# Read the failing tests to understand what to implement
# Implement the basic extensions in the specified files
# Re-run tests until they all pass
```

### How Test-Driven Understanding Works

When you run the tests, you'll see:
- ✅ **Existing functionality tests pass** - the current code works
- ❌ **Extension tests fail** - you need to implement these

**This is intentional!** Each failing test shows:
1. **What extension to implement** (enhanced calculator, new tools, etc.)
2. **Where to implement it** (specific file paths)
3. **Expected behavior** (inputs, outputs, requirements)

## 🎯 Objective
Gain a deep understanding of the current LangGraph implementation by examining the codebase, then proving your knowledge through hands-on implementation of basic extensions.

## 📚 What You'll Learn
- How LangGraph state management works with `MessagesState`
- The difference between custom and prebuilt agent implementations
- Tool integration patterns and how to create custom tools
- Memory checkpointing and session management
- Streaming responses and real-time communication
- FastAPI integration patterns

## 🔍 Current Implementation Analysis

### Core Components

#### 1. **State Management** (`src/agent/core.py`)
- Uses `MessagesState` from LangGraph for conversation state
- Tracks messages, tool calls, and metadata
- Session-based state isolation

#### 2. **Tool System**
- Three basic tools: `get_current_time`, `calculate`, `echo`
- Tool decorator pattern for easy extension
- Safe execution with error handling

#### 3. **Graph Construction**
- Custom `StateGraph` with conditional edges
- Tool execution flow: `agent` → `tools` → `agent`
- Memory checkpointing for persistence

#### 4. **Modern Implementation** (`src/agent/modern.py`)
- Uses `create_react_agent` prebuilt component
- Simplified API with same functionality
- Demonstrates best practices

## 🧪 Test-Driven Learning Exercises

**IMPORTANT**: These exercises are validated by failing tests. You must implement the solutions to make tests pass!

### Exercise 1: Tool Extensions (TestBasicToolExtensions)
**Goal**: Prove understanding by extending existing tools

**Tasks**:
1. **Enhanced Calculator** - Extend calculator to support power (^), sqrt(), and percentage operations
2. **New Utility Tools** - Create reverse_string, word_count, and upper_lower tools  
3. **Enhanced Agent** - Create LearningEnhancedAgent that includes all tools

**Implementation Files**: 
- `src/agent/learning_extensions.py`

**Test Command**: `pytest docs/learning-plans/test_learning_01.py::TestBasicToolExtensions -v`

### Exercise 2: State Management Extensions (TestBasicStateExtensions)  
**Goal**: Demonstrate understanding of state management

**Tasks**:
1. **Session Tracker** - Create SessionState and SessionTracker classes
2. **Message Analyzer** - Build MessageHistoryAnalyzer for conversation insights

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/agent/learning_extensions.py`

**Test Command**: `pytest docs/learning-plans/test_learning_01.py::TestBasicStateExtensions -v`

### Exercise 3: Graph Extensions (TestBasicGraphExtensions)
**Goal**: Demonstrate understanding of graph construction

**Tasks**:
1. **Conditional Routing** - Create ConditionalRoutingAgent with different paths for questions vs commands
2. **Logging Wrapper** - Build LoggingGraphWrapper to track graph execution

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/agent/learning_extensions.py`

**Test Command**: `pytest docs/learning-plans/test_learning_01.py::TestBasicGraphExtensions -v`

### Exercise 4: API Extensions (TestBasicAPIExtensions)
**Goal**: Prove understanding of API integration patterns

**Tasks**:
1. **Tool Info Endpoint** - Create GET /tools/info to list all available tools
2. **Session Stats Endpoint** - Create GET /session/{id}/stats for session analytics

**Implementation Files**:
- `src/api/learning_routes.py`
- Update `main.py` to include new routes

**Test Command**: `pytest docs/learning-plans/test_learning_01.py::TestBasicAPIExtensions -v`
