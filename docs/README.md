# LangGraph Learning Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive learning materials for mastering LangGraph and building production-ready agent systems.

## 📚 Learning Plans

The learning plans are located in the `learning-plans/` directory and provide a structured path from basic understanding to advanced production patterns.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run Learning Plan 1 tests
make test-learning-01

# Run Learning Plan 2 tests  
make test-learning-02

# Run all learning plan tests
make test-learning-all
```

### Learning Path

1. **[Understand Current Code](learning-plans/01-understand-current-code.md)** - Master the existing implementation
2. **[Interfaces and Extensibility](learning-plans/02-interfaces-and-extensibility.md)** - Deep dive into LangGraph interfaces
3. **[State Stores and Persistence](learning-plans/03-state-stores-and-persistence.md)** - Master state management patterns
4. **[Production Patterns](learning-plans/04-production-patterns.md)** - Learn production-ready patterns
5. **[MuleSoft Integration](learning-plans/05-mulesoft-integration.md)** - Integrate with MuleSoft ecosystems

## 🧪 Testing Your Progress

Each learning plan includes comprehensive test files that validate your understanding:

```bash
# Run tests for a specific learning plan
cd learning-plans
python test_learning_01.py
python test_learning_02.py

# Or use the Makefile
make test-learning-01
make test-learning-02
```

## 📋 Success Criteria

Complete each learning plan when you can:
- [ ] Pass all tests in the learning plan
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding through code examples
- [ ] Successfully implement all exercises
- [ ] Explain concepts to others
- [ ] Apply patterns to new problems

## 🔄 Iterative Learning

The learning plans are designed for iterative learning:

1. **Read** the learning plan overview
2. **Study** the current codebase
3. **Implement** the exercises
4. **Test** your implementation
5. **Reflect** on what you learned
6. **Move** to the next plan

## 🤝 Getting Help

- Check the test files for implementation hints
- Review the existing codebase for patterns
- Use the additional resources for deeper understanding
- Ask questions and share your progress
