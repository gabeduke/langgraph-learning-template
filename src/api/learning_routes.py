Learning API Routes for Learning Plan 1

üéØ This file contains STUB implementations for Learning Plan 1 API exercises.
You need to complete these implementations to make the tests pass.

After implementing these routes, add them to main.py:
    from api.learning_routes import learning_router
    app.include_router(learning_router)
